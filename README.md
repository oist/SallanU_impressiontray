## Abstract
Dental impressions, developed for accurate capture of oral characteristics in human clinical settings, are seldom used in research on nonlivestock, nonprimate, and especially nonmammalian vertebrates due to a lack of appropriate tools. Studies of dentitions in most vertebrate species usually require euthanasia and specimen dissection, microCT and other scans with size and resolution tradeoffs, and/or ad-hoc individual impressions or removal of single teeth. These approaches prevent in-vivo studies that factor in growth and other chronological changes and separate teeth from the context of the whole mouth. Here, we describe a non-destructive method for obtaining high-resolution dentition-related traits that can be used on both living animals and museum specimens for almost all vertebrates, involving a customizable and printable dental impression tray. This method has repeatedly and accurately captured whole-mouth morphology and detailed features at high resolution in the living non-teleost actinopterygian fish, *Polypterus senegalus*, in a laboratory setting. It can be used for comparative morphology and to observe temporal changes such as the presence of microwear, tooth replacement rates, and occlusal and morphological changes through ontogeny.
